## The One Ring

### Goal

### Obstacle Ideas

- Enemies (patrol?, sight?)
- Traps

### Multiple Use Ideas

- invisiblity
- see hidden things
- slows time
- adds double jump
- changes player movement speeds
- certain enemies drawn to you
- timer? nazgul or the eye finds you

### Simple Gameplay

Platformer, godot

- platforms
- - 3 levels?
- - 1 big level}?
- player can't fight, only takes damage
- collectables?
- triggers that unlock parts of the map?
- the ring can be used to access more of the map
